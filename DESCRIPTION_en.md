# 🌿 Deep Breath: Break the Endless Scroll Loop
Reclaim control of your attention. Less cheap dopamine, more presence.

Have you ever caught yourself watching the same short video for the fifth time without even realizing it? Or scrolling through YouTube Shorts, TikTok, or Instagram feeds for hours as if you were in a trance?

Deep Breath is the first intelligent extension that uses behavioral detection to identify when you've entered a "dopamine loop" and helps you break free in a gentle and effective way.

## 🚀 What makes Deep Breath different?
Unlike common blockers that simply close the site, Deep Breath monitors your behavior in real-time:

**Replay Detection**: If you watch the same video repeatedly, the extension notices that your brain is "stuck" on the content.

**Speed Monitoring**: Identifies when you're frantically scrolling, desperately searching for the next stimulus.

**Sensory Intervention**: Instead of aggressive error screens, we soften the screen colors and start an immersive "cloud" soundtrack, creating space for you to breathe and consciously decide if you want to continue.

## 👨👩👧👦 For Parents: A Healthier Internet for Your Children
We know how difficult it is to manage children's and teenagers' screen time. Deep Breath acts as a silent digital educator:

**Education Instead of Prohibition**: Instead of blocking and generating conflict, the extension teaches young people to recognize the "trance" state, encouraging self-control.

**Reduced Hyperstimulation**: The visual and sound filter calms the nervous system, combating anxiety caused by fast and loud videos.

**Focus on Studies**: Set "Full Focus" mode on the study computer to ensure endless scrolling doesn't divert attention from schoolwork.

## 🎯 3 Intensity Levels
Choose how you want to be reminded to return to the real world:

🧘 **Zen Mode**: A gentle reminder. Allows more freedom but acts when excess is evident. Video slows down slightly to 0.8x.

⚖️ **Medium Mode (Balanced)**: The perfect balance between productivity and leisure. Activates after 4 video changes or replays.

🎯 **Full Focus**: Immediate intervention. Reduces video speed to 0.2x and blocks scrolling. Ideal for those who need a "handbrake" against digital addiction or for deep study moments.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Immersive Sound**: High-quality audio (Brown Noise/Ambient) that cancels out social media noise.
- **Therapeutic Visual Filter**: Desaturated colors that reduce the visual appeal of videos.
- **Internationalization**: Available in Portuguese, English, Spanish, and French.
- **Total Privacy**: 100% local processing. Your data never leaves your computer.

Stop scrolling. Start breathing. Install Deep Breath today and master your time again.
